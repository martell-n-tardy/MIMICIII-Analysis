# MIMICIII-Analysis

A probe into the MIMIC III dataset. Using decision-tree based algorithms and Machine Learning algorithms such as: XGBoost, LightGBM, and GBDT for model validation and deployment.

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to predict the mortality of patients with AMI (Acute Myocardinal Infarction).

## The Data:
MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.

The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and mortality (both in and out of hospital).

MIMIC supports a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule improvement, and electronic tool development. It is notable for three factors:

  - it is freely available to researchers worldwide
  - it encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients
  - it contains high temporal resolution data including lab results, electronic documentation, and bedside monitor trends and waveforms.
